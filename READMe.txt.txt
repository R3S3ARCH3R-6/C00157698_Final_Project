CMPS 327 Final Project

The final project runs very well. All the buttons in the "Game Over" and "Main Menu" scenes work, and all three games can be accessed.

Major bugs that once existed, like the "Third-Person" scene acting more like a "First-Person" game and the incredibly small text, have been fixed.

The only bugs that really exist in the game are the mini-map icons being of different sizes and some of the fruits and food not being accessbile because they have melted into the terrain. Bullets will still fire from destroyed enemies too, but this lasts for only a second and can work with the game as a "shot from the grave."

The only other problem is the Git Repository. I will have a link to the Git in the text file GitHubLink.txt.
